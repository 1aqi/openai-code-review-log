### Git Diff Review

#### File: `openai-code-review-sdk/src/main/java/cn/aqi/middleware/sdk/types/utils/WXAccessTokenUtils.java`

#### Changes:

1. **Method Signature Change**:
   - The method `getAccessToken(String appId, String secret)` has been modified from `getAccessToken(String APPID, String SECRET)`. This change suggests that the method now accepts constants for `APPID` and `SECRET` instead of the string literals `appId` and `secret`. This is a good practice as it can make the code more readable and prevent accidental misspelling of these sensitive values.

2. **Class and Method Removal**:
   - The entire inner class `Token` and its associated getter and setter methods have been removed. This suggests that the token management logic has been removed from this utility class. If the token management is no longer needed, this is a clean change. However, if it was removed by mistake or if the token information is still required, this change should be reviewed carefully.

3. **Method Implementation**:
   - The implementation of `getAccessToken` now uses `APPID` and `SECRET` instead of `appId` and `secret`. The URL string is formatted using these new constants.
   - The method `getAccessToken` has been updated to include a try-catch block, which is a good practice for handling exceptions that may occur when making HTTP requests.

#### Potential Issues and Considerations:

- **Removed Token Management Logic**: The removal of the `Token` class and its methods could be a significant change if token management is critical to the functionality of the application. Ensure that there is a replacement for this logic or that the application can function without it.
  
- **Use of Constants**: The use of constants for `APPID` and `SECRET` is a good practice, but ensure that these constants are defined and managed correctly to prevent sensitive information from being exposed.

- **Exception Handling**: The try-catch block in the `getAccessToken` method is good, but it's important to log the exception details for debugging purposes. Also, consider how the exception will be handled by the calling code.

- **Code Readability**: The change from using string literals to constants improves readability. Ensure that the rest of the codebase follows this pattern for consistency.

#### Recommendations:

- Verify that the removal of the `Token` class and its methods is intentional and that the application still functions as expected.
- Ensure that the constants `APPID` and `SECRET` are defined securely and that their values are not hardcoded in the source code.
- Add appropriate logging within the try-catch block to assist with debugging if an exception occurs.
- Review the rest of the code to ensure consistency in the use of constants for sensitive information.
- Update any documentation that references the removed `Token` class and its methods to reflect the current state of the code.
